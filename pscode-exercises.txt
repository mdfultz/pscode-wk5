// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

	Print "Please enter the first number"
	Input num1
	Print "Please enter the second number"
	Input num2
	sum = num1+num2
	Print "The sum of the two number is:" sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
	
	Print "Please enter a number."
	Input num
	remain = num%2
	if remain != 0
		Print num "is an odd number"
	Else
		Print num "is an even number"



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)
	x=1
	while x <=5
		Print "Enter number" x "of 5."
		Input num(x)
		x= x+1
	
b)
	total = 0
	x=1
	while x<=5
		total = total + num(x)
		x=x+1
	average = total/5

c)
	smallest = num1
	largest = num1
	x=2
	
	while x<=5
		if smallest <= num(x)
			smallest = num(x)
		else
			largest = num(x)
d)
	Print "The average of the 5 numbers is:" average
	Print "The smallest number is:" smallest
	Print "The largest number is :" largest
